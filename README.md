#MP3 Mixtape Maker
A Windows utility for compiling, renaming and packaging files for mp3 compilations.

So you wanna make a mixtape? You've got mp3 files scattered across multiple directories. Maybe you've got a playlist file containing all of the songs in the correct order? 

**MP3 Mixtape Maker** takes your .m3u playlist file (supported by nearly every mp3 player software in existence) and copies all of the files to a folder of your choice. You can then rename the files, number then sequentially, and zip them.

##How To Use
From the *Add Files* tab, click the *Add MP3 Files* button to select files to add to your compilation. If you have an .m3u playlist that you wish to import, clock the *Add Playlist* button. The files you've selected will appear in the list below.

When you are ready to gather your files, click the *Copy Files to Folder* button. Select or create the folder that you wish to copy your music files to. The display will switch to the *Edit Compilation* tab.

Here, you can rename and reorder files. To rename a file, simply double-click the file name in the list and start typing. Use the *Move Up* and *Move Down* buttons to re-order titles in the list. The *Auto Number* button will strip any numbering from the file names and re-number them in the order that they appear in the list.

If you need to work with a previous compilation, click the *Select Folder* button (small folder icon at the far right) to select a folder to open in the *Edit Compilation* tab. 

Once your files are re-named and organized, click the *Create Playlist* button to create an M3U playlist, or the *Zip Files* button to zip up the files in the list. 

##To Do (maybe)
Add mp3 tagging capabilities. There are a lot of programs however that do this.
